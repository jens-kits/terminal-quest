locations:
  - name: "City Entrance"
    description: "You stand at the entrance of an abandoned city. Towering skyscrapers loom overhead, their windows dark and empty. The streets are overgrown with vegetation, nature reclaiming what was once lost. A faint electronic hum permeates the air. A rusty sign nearby catches your attention. To the east, you notice a small, dilapidated shed."
    exits:
      n: "Dome"
      e: "Maintenance Shed"
    items:
      - "rusty key"
    objects:
      rusty sign: "The rusty sign reads: 'Welcome to Neo-Stockholm - Where AI and Humanity Coexist'. The irony is palpable."
      skyscrapers: "The towering skyscrapers loom ominously, their windows like empty eye sockets staring down at you."
      vegetation: "Thick vines and wild plants have overtaken the streets, pushing through cracks in the pavement and climbing up the buildings."
    hint: "Try examining the objects around you. The rusty sign might have some useful information."

  - name: "Dome"
    description: "You approach a large domed structure. As you get closer, you realize it's an ancient botanical garden. The dome is cracked, but amazingly, plant life thrives inside. A control panel near the entrance flickers with dim light."
    exits:
      s: "City Entrance"
    objects:
      control panel: "The control panel is a complex array of buttons, switches, and screens. Most of it is dark, but a few lights still blink sporadically."
      crack: "The crack in the dome is substantial. It's a wonder the structure is still standing. Through the crack, you can see lush vegetation inside, thriving despite (or perhaps because of) the lack of human intervention."
    hint: "The control panel seems important. Try interacting with it and examining it closely. You might need to find a keycard somewhere."
    interactions:
      control panel:
        menu:
          - name: "Adjust Environmental Controls"
            result: "The environmental controls are offline. It seems the system needs more power."
          - name: "Access Security Systems"
            result: "The security systems appear to be offline. You can see options for camera controls, door locks, and alarm systems, but they all require proper authorization to access."
          - name: "Check Communication Array"
            result: "The communication array is non-functional. It seems to have been damaged long ago. You can see options for local and long-range communications, but nothing responds to your touch."
          - name: "Manage Power Systems"
            result: "The power management system shows critical levels. Most of the city's power grid seems to be offline or operating at minimal capacity."
          - name: "Use keycard slot"
            action: "use_keycard"
            result: "You need a keycard to use this function."
          - name: "Examine panel closely"
            description: "Upon closer inspection, you notice a small label near the keycard slot. It reads: 'Emergency Override - Authorized Personnel Only'."

  - name: "Maintenance Shed"
    description: "You enter a small, dusty maintenance shed. Tools and spare parts litter the shelves and workbenches. Despite the years of neglect, it seems that this place once served an important function in maintaining the city's infrastructure."
    exits:
      w: "City Entrance"
    items:
      - "keycard"
    objects:
      workbench: "An old workbench covered in dust and cobwebs. Various tools are scattered across its surface."

    description: "A sleek, electronic keycard. It looks like it might grant access to important systems."
